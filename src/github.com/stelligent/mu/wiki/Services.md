# Services
Services are first pushed to an ECR repository and then deployed to a specific environment.  Each service is a CloudFormation stack consisting of the following resources:

* **Task Definition** â€“ An ECS task definition referencing the image and tag in the ECR repo.
* **Service** - An ECS service referencing the Task Definition.
* **Target Group** - An ALB target group for the Service to reference and register containers in.
* **Listener Rule** - A rule in the ALB listener from the environment to route specific URLs to the target group.

## Configuration
```
---

### Define the service for this repo
service:
  name: my-service                   # The unique name of the service (default: the name of the directory that mu.yml was in)
  desiredCount: 4                    # The desired number of tasks to run for the service (default: 2)
  dockerfile: ./Dockerfile           # The relative path to the Dockerfile to build images (default: ./Dockerfile)
  imageRepository: tutum/hello-world # The repository to push images to and deploy services from.  Leave unset to have mu manage an ECR repository (default: none)
  port: 80                           # The port to expose from the container (default: 8080)
  healthEndpoint: /health            # The endpoint inside the container to determine if the task is healthy (default: /health)
  cpu: 20                            # The number of CPU units to allocate to each task (default: 10)
  memory: 400                        # The amount of memory in MiB to allocate to each task (default: 300)

  # The paths to match on in the ALB and route to this service.  Leave blank to not create an ALB target group for this service (default: none)
  pathPatterns:
    - /bananas
    - /apples

  # The priority for resolving the pathPatterns from the ALB (between 1 and 99999)
  priority: 25

  # Environment variables
  environment:
    DB_TYPE: mysql                  # Define an environment variable for all environments by have a string for value
    DB_URL:                         # Define an different value per environment by have a map for value
        dev:  10.0.0.1:3306
        prod: 10.0.100.5:3306

```

## Commands
```
